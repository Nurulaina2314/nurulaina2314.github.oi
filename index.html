    <h1>EXPERIENCE
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p class="w3-text-blue-grey w3-large"><b>Experience in school, </b></p>
    <p>The best moment in class was when I was form 2 in middle high school. That was when I got confident to talk into poetry and spoken word. Having that “character and scene” class made my life even greater. Not knowing anything about debates, hating on debates about reading and writing it in the past. That class was fun in many ways. For example, there was this one time where we had to write our own ideas about government topic and debates between the class members. I felt alive, and the creative side of me came out. When I wrote my idea and speak up my opinion, I just  realized that it was fun and unique. I felt like I gain more confident and wanted to write more talk more in front the audiences. When I performed idea about the government topic as the government side in front my classmates, I was so confident and getting many praises because of my smooth and arrangement words. Since that day and today I have confident to speak in front of many people and since that day I have join many debates competition . I have performed on many stages in small audience and in school. That was a good day for me because I can confidently speak in front of many people, write my own idea, and tell my opinion in the debates. With my experience, I just thought that people can learn that you must doing something with confident then you will know what skill you have and find what best fits you.</p>

    <ul type="square" class="w3-text-blue-grey w3-large"><b>Experience in work</b>
     
    <li>Work in renew insurance agent office as clerk</li>
    <p>The best experience as I work as renew customer insurance and road tax on the office of Sri Fatimah Sdn Bhd is I’m always deal with many kinds of customer and face many challenges while working. For example, there are some customers that have many complain on our work and cancel the insurance and road tax in last minute. It has caused many problems to fix it as the process we need to call the agent of the insurance company and must deal with JPJ officers. It was the best experience for me as I was 18 years old and did not know anything about handling customer but with that experience, I have gain confident and ready to face challenges in working in future.</p>
    <li>Work in shopping complex as cashier</li>
    <p>The best experience work as cashier is,  there are many advantages of working in retail is the availability of clearance items. The staff know where to look for them, when they'll be reduced even more, and what the lowest price will be. Some stores mark down clearance items to a specific degree, then mark them down again later to get them out of the store as quickly as possible. They'll have more room for new products this way. Knowing when this occurs, how frequently it occurs, and when the optimum time to purchase these clearance items is beneficial.</p>

   <center><u><h1>Place of Education</h1></u>

   <p class="w3-large w3-text-black">For my education, I start my education same like the other which at age 7 years old at Sekolah Kebangsaan St Anne's Convent. There are many memories and experinece that I can't forget each time I look back on my childhood time. That was the place I start to know the world, learn about many things on how to grow up and more. Then I continue my study on middle high school at age 13 years old at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan St Anne's Convent. In this age and level of education have changed, people at our age need to be more serious in study to get a excellent result. Thank god, with my effort and support from my family, teachers and friends I have get a good result for my examination. When we have passed the childhood time, we have to move to the adult life which is at age 18 years old. I'm continue my study to the high level of education which is at university. I have been accepeted by UITM,Merbok at Kedah in course Information Management. In this age, we will realize that our repsonsibilities became more bigger and there are many challenges as universities students that must be face. You have to been strong physical and mental to face the problem and I really hope to finish my Diploma with A banger, and if not I will be grateful with my result as I know how hard Im struggle in study the course subject. </p>

    <h1>FAMILY BACKGROUND
    </h1><br>

   <title>Family</title>
   </head>
   <center><h1><u>My family background</u></h1>

<p>This is story about my background family. I can say that my family is an normal family like others but every time we have problems we will always be together and solve it together . my story start with I have such a happy memories with my parents and in 2015 and 2016 my life change when they gone. So right now, it’s only  me, my brother, sister, and younger sister that left. Even though they have gone, we always take care each other and create many memories since we do not close enough back then.</p>

<p>For me this is the definition of a true family. A group of people that have each other's backs and are willing to go to any length to put a smile on someone else's face. The true family definition is a sense of loyalty, selflessness, love, and genuine care and concern for others, whether you call it a true family or a real family.</p>

<p>Not only that, A family's relationship is indestructible; it can be tested, but it can never be severed. Your genuine family will always be within arm's reach, no matter how bad things become. They'll be there to assist you in your battles and to guide you down the long road of life. After all, a family is what makes a person's life worthwhile, and we should appreciate family in its genuine sense.</p>
